I would classify Victoria Modesta as posthuman, the beginning of her video shows her as a disabled person, perfecting herself and accepting herself through
technological means. In the film, she has mechanical, glowing legs, and in my understanding, posthumanism is a broader term for a philosophical and 
cultural shift away from traditional humanism. More than anything, she believes that technology is changing humanity and can blur the relationship between
technology and humanity. the goal of transhumanism is to transcend the limitations of the human body and mind and create a new type of post-human being.

She installed mechanical legs for her performance and gained a following of fans who embraced her, sought after by people whose bodies have been transformed by technology. This is very much in line with post-humanity, enhancing people's own understanding and self-awareness by breaking traditional thinking and ethics, as well as being a movement in thought and culture.

Victoria's work challenges traditional notions of disability, beauty, and performance, and raises important questions about the role of technology in shaping our identity and our relationship with the world around us. By embracing her prosthetic leg as a unique part of her identity and incorporating it into her performances, Victoria Modesta represents a new kind of post-human artist who celebrates the potential of technology to transform and enhance the human experience.
