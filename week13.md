## Object of Desire:
Stepping into the venue, the whole set-up is dim, with the use of vivid colors and light and shade yet it does a great job of highlighting the quirky and grotesque feel of the exhibits. Just entering the pavilion one can see many classic surrealist designs such as Dali's lobster phone and red lip sofa and Gaudi's love seat and reinforces the design theme by showcasing these widely recognized and valued artworks, artists, and cultural traditions. This can perpetuate existing power dynamics and reinforce established ways of thinking about the world.
