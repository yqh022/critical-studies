## Object of Desire:
Stepping into the venue, the whole set-up is dim, with the use of vivid colors and light and shade yet it does a great job of highlighting the quirky and grotesque feel of the exhibits. Just entering the pavilion one can see many classic surrealist designs such as Dali's lobster phone and red lip sofa and Gaudi's love seat and reinforces the design theme by showcasing these widely recognized and valued artworks, artists, and cultural traditions. This can perpetuate existing power dynamics and reinforce established ways of thinking about the world.

The exhibition covers a wide range of forms, historically, Surrealism emerged in the 1920s, many of which dealt with themes such as desire and death, and was closer to human emotions than many artistic approaches. Exploring the subconscious, breaking away from the constraints of rationalism, and challenging everyday conventions.

I love this chair, it's novel and interesting that the artist has tried to bypass existing forms of production and translate them into a 3D printed form by using gesture capture and motion capture technology to make paintings in an automated way.

At the same time, I noticed that many photographs and paintings about female power and sexuality, between families, were placed in the exhibition, challenging the stereotypes that gender brings.This can help to challenge existing power dynamics and promote greater diversity, equity, and inclusion in the art world.

Including artificial intelligence and google's dream program in the back, new artistic approaches have gradually emerged with the development of digital technology.This can encourage visitors to question established categories and narratives and to develop new ways of understanding the world.

The exhibition presents the changes in time and the development of the art form in a chronological order. Arranging the exhibits according to the changing cultural context is more objective and avoids getting bogged down in one's own interpretation, presenting a more open and tolerant attitude towards the exhibits. This also helps the audience to better understand the context in which the exhibits were designed and the attitudes that the artworks themselves are intended to convey, but there is relatively little interaction with the audience and the risk of misunderstanding if there is insufficient understanding of the historical and cultural background behind them.
## Create my own exhibition:
Immersive experiences can be achieved through the incorporation of video or music. This can be achieved, for example, through the incorporation of digital technology and through web curation through a collection of morphological models that index conceptual exhibition forms. Visitors use web searches to translate information about exhibits, understand content, catalog and receive information from others, and better understand and visit exhibits. In Weber's Graphical Sign Systems: for example the ability to assemble a two-dimensional map by analyzing data and information presented in tabular and textual form, combining an index of social media such as Twitter with the interconnection of specific hashtags. By embodying the principles of a graphic system, form and content are linked.
