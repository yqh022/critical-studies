I think low-tech is an interesting topic, and in a world where technology is everywhere, low-tech activities can feel like a refreshing change of pace. The simplicity and ease of understanding of low tech allow it to be better democratized and suitable for most people to withhold learning and practice. As the low-tech website says, it encourages more independence at all levels and a more even distribution of values or work. Equally ordinary people need low-tech activities, such as reading a book or going for a walk, that can be calming and allow people to get away from their computer screens and take a break from the stimulation of technology. low tech is the technology that is relatively simple, uncomplicated and usually requires little or no electricity. Low-tech solutions are usually cheaper, more readily available and easier to maintain than high-tech solutions. 

Examples of low tech include using hand tools to construct buildings, using manual typewriters or pen and paper instead of computers, using bicycles or walking as a means of transport, and using traditional farming methods instead of heavy machinery. Low-tech solutions can be found in many areas, from healthcare to education to agriculture, and they can provide effective solutions to complex problems. Low-tech solutions often use fewer resources and have a lower environmental impact than higher-tech solutions. They can also be designed to be more durable and long-lasting, reducing the need for frequent replacement and disposal. For example, equipment is often prioritized to be safe and clean, recyclable and how can be stored properly to ensure its longevity and availability. Low-tech innovations focus on creating simple solutions that are easy to implement and maintain, for example using simple hand tools to service machines, focusing on using renewable resources such as solar or wind power to create sustainable solutions.

Low-tech solutions are often cheaper and easier to access and maintain than higher-tech solutions. They can be designed to work with limited resources, which makes them ideal for developing countries or regions with limited infrastructure. Low-tech usually focuses on local resources, traditional knowledge and skills and simple solutions to real problems in a sustainable and accessible way.
