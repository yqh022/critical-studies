Literacy is traditionally the ability to read and write and is a key indicator of a population's educational attainment. And over time includes not only the ability to read and write traditional texts but also the ability to understand and use new forms of communication and information technology. Literacy is an important tool for individuals to participate fully in society, access information and resources, and pursue personal and professional goals.
Literacy is essential for effective communication, as it allows individuals to read and write messages, instructions, and information. Literacy is a prerequisite for formal education, as it is essential for learning and understanding wrote the material, such as textbooks and lecture notes. Literacy provides individuals with the ability to access information, news, and entertainment, which can broaden their knowledge, understanding, and perspectives. Literacy is important for informed political and civic participation, as it enables individuals to understand and engage with political and social issues.

When computer programming is referred to as literacy, it means that it is considered an essential skill, similar to traditional literacies such as reading and writing, implying that the ability to use and understand digital technologies such as computers, the Internet, and mobile devices is necessary for people to participate in the digital future. Computer programming should be seen as an essential skill in a rapidly changing technological environment and should be taught in schools and widely disseminated, available to people of all ages and backgrounds. It provides individuals with the ability to solve problems and express themselves through code, and is increasingly in demand in many industries from software development to data analytics, offering more opportunities for people to learn or work.
## After reading the assigned:
The programming system is building a new and complex cultural ecology.A section of the population once tried to make computer programming the exclusive domain of professionals, but as it stands now, computer code has gradually come to form the bulk of our contemporary communications, with our employment, health records and citizenship, once recorded only in text, now being coded into computer databases.The ubiquity of computing has meant that programming has emerged from the exclusive domain of computer science and the specialist areas that permeate it. In the age of digital technology, programming seems to be more fundamental than other digital skills known as literacy, so we can think of programming as a platform literacy.

Programming reveals the new social practices and technologies that make up contemporary literacy, and it can show us what the complex ecology of literacy looks like. But with this comes the influence of religious ideologies, educational systems and gender dynamics, among other social forces.
More complex and more widely distributed programming technologies in seem to put more pressure on individual literacy, raising the level of skills required for a person to be considered 'literate', which affects the literacy requirements and to some extent the implicit class divisions of some people.
In her work on the cycle of low literacy, Victoria Purcell-Gates has shown that children growing up in environments where writing is absent and literacy is marginalised have little way of integrating literacy into their lives. If we think of coding in terms of literacy rather than occupation, these insights from literacy research suggest that we must think critically to expand the use of coding.
