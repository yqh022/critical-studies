Literacy is traditionally the ability to read and write and is a key indicator of a population's educational attainment. And over time includes not only the ability to read and write traditional texts but also the ability to understand and use new forms of communication and information technology. Literacy is an important tool for individuals to participate fully in society, access information and resources, and pursue personal and professional goals.
Literacy is essential for effective communication, as it allows individuals to read and write messages, instructions, and information. Literacy is a prerequisite for formal education, as it is essential for learning and understanding wrote the material, such as textbooks and lecture notes. Literacy provides individuals with the ability to access information, news, and entertainment, which can broaden their knowledge, understanding, and perspectives. Literacy is important for informed political and civic participation, as it enables individuals to understand and engage with political and social issues.

When computer programming is referred to as literacy, it means that it is considered an essential skill, similar to traditional literacies such as reading and writing, implying that the ability to use and understand digital technologies such as computers, the Internet, and mobile devices is necessary for people to participate in the digital future. Computer programming should be seen as an essential skill in a rapidly changing technological environment and should be taught in schools and widely disseminated, available to people of all ages and backgrounds. It provides individuals with the ability to solve problems and express themselves through code, and is increasingly in demand in many industries from software development to data analytics, offering more opportunities for people to learn or work.

The programming system is building a new and complex cultural ecology.A section of the population once tried to make computer programming the exclusive domain of professionals, but as it stands now, computer code has gradually come to form the bulk of our contemporary communications, with our employment, health records and citizenship, once recorded only in text, now being coded into computer databases.The ubiquity of computing has meant that programming has emerged from the exclusive domain of computer science and the specialist areas that permeate it. In the age of digital technology, programming seems to be more fundamental than other digital skills known as literacy, so we can think of programming as a platform literacy.

Programming reveals the new social practices and technologies that make up contemporary literacy, and it can show us what the complex ecology of literacy looks like. But with this comes the influence of religious ideologies, educational systems and gender dynamics, among other social forces.
More complex and more widely distributed programming technologies in seem to put more pressure on individual literacy, raising the level of skills required for a person to be considered 'literate', which affects the literacy requirements and to some extent the implicit class divisions of some people.
In her work on the cycle of low literacy, Victoria Purcell-Gates has shown that children growing up in environments where writing is absent and literacy is marginalised have little way of integrating literacy into their lives. If we think of coding in terms of literacy rather than occupation, these insights from literacy research suggest that we must think critically to expand the use of coding.

With the development of digital literacy, issues such as the political culture brought about by online platforms have emerged, and the results of algorithmic platforms are rarely automatic, As Safiya Umoja Noble has pointed out, the reification of racial and gender bias in search results can be naturalized by algorithms, ostensibly absolving humans from blame because the "computer did it. "Issues such as power equality and discrimination also affects the human-controlled algorithms of the Internet.

How programming has flowed from the specialist field of computer science to other fields suggests that it is becoming a literacy - that is, a widely held ability to compose and interpret symbols and communicate texts in an infrastructure medium. When programming is combined with traditional forms of artistic performance, real-time coding is a proposed new way of operating and poses new questions and challenges to the values and forms underlying computer culture more generally. Artists use code as material and the boundaries between artistic visuals, music, game development, etc., and traditional technology become blurred. In this context, coding and everyday life come together in imperceptible ways. Language comes to life through the body, communication with others, and the writing system. 

The book 'Live coding: a user's manual' suggests that live coding can transform the human experience of technology through these same connections. Live coding sets technology up to be transformed and explored, including through the live redesign of musical instruments or the live rewriting of musical scores. Rejecting simple definitions, live coding is a new approach that continues to challenge traditional forms of artistic performance and uses programming as a new form of performance expression to communicate with the audience.
