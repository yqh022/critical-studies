After identifying the keywords "computational thinking" and "culture" I started searching in the Google Scholar search engine and soon found that the search was too broad and that it was a challenge to avoid being overwhelmed by the amount of information that needed to be collected and analyzed. I also found it difficult to help me narrow down my research and identify and refine my research questions, which could lead to a lack of clarity in my research objectives and results.

In order to narrow down the scope of the study, I have circled the topic as the implications for the future of cultural education under the development of computational thinking.After changing the search term to "Computational thinking" and "Culture of education", I got 80 results, and if I ticked Include academic citations, I got about 90 results, so it seems that there are relatively few relevant journal papers, so I considered adding several aspects of digital thinking that might have an impact on the culture as keywords to supplement the search.

The development of computational thinking has the potential to transform cultural education by enhancing intercultural communication and cooperation, preserving cultural heritage, promoting creativity in learning, and alleviating cultural bias.I got 110 results for the keyword: "Computational thinking" "Cross-cultural communication", but some of these sites are unviewable and contain a lot of content. They contain articles that have nothing to do with computational thinking and everything to do with cultural education models.

A search for articles on the role of computational thinking in fostering creativity yielded an article on "Effective components of creativity in early childhood digital play learning: a case study" as a theoretical support for this aspect of cultural creativity. I clicked on some of the articles with a high number of citations and looked at their profiles to make a note of the articles on the topic of cultural development.
