After identifying the keywords "computational thinking" and "culture" I started searching in the Google Scholar search engine and soon found that the search was too broad and that it was a challenge to avoid being overwhelmed by the amount of information that needed to be collected and analyzed. I also found it difficult to help me narrow down my research and identify and refine my research questions, which could lead to a lack of clarity in my research objectives and results.

In order to narrow down the scope of the study, I have circled the topic as the implications for the future of cultural education under the development of computational thinking.After changing the search term to "Computational thinking" and "Culture of education", I got 80 results, and if I ticked Include academic citations, I got about 90 results, so it seems that there are relatively few relevant journal papers, so I considered adding several aspects of digital thinking that might have an impact on the culture as keywords to supplement the search.
