 a new space station, one where difference is not erased but embraced：

## for the space environment aspect：
Ensure that the space station has sufficient space and supports mobility aids such as wheelchairs and prostheses. It has a wide site to avoid narrow and obstructed passages, sloping ramps, and multiple styles of handrails aided by tactile and auditory aids. The environment within the space station should be adaptable to accommodate people with sensory impairments, such as lighting and temperature control. Consider incorporating assistive technologies such as voice control and large displays for precise control using different modalities.
The use of different sensory equipment on vehicles, handrails, and structures at different heights and the use of new robotic assistants are reducing the need for people to perform routine tasks.

## In terms of personal safety: 

Emergency evacuation procedures should be designed with accessibility to ensure that everyone can safely evacuate the station in case of an emergency.Including assistive technology and communication tools, to support people with diverse abilities and backgrounds. Appropriate machine systems and procedures are in place to deal with medical emergencies, fires, equipment failures, and other potential hazards. Due to the confined environment of the space station, there is a need for better set-up for some emergency response equipment, such as fire extinguishers and medical supplies that need to be more accessible, ensuring the safe evacuation of people with disabilities.

## Humanities and Arts:
The region encourages diverse and inclusive disability arts, wearable design and assistive design, with more inclusive art forms that inspire and facilitate people to express their differences and artistic language in different ways and to design assistive products that meet their own needs in life.

## Technical staff selection：
For people with disabilities it will no longer be a service for (supposedly) unfortunate disabled people, but will involve them as developers of technology, eliminating the "special needs" perspective and jointly driving technological change.
Design and technology for people with disabilities will be allowed to co-exist in society, rather than forcing one party to integrate and assimilate, judging by their ability.Technical staff to assist in the design of accessible spaces and meetings.

There are times when the wealth of life experience is not available to the average specialist. Enabling people with disabilities to live independently and making disability and other forms of interdependence can be achieved by redesigning objects with representations of disability as an expression of challenging existing disability science.They will find crip knowing-making in the design and implementation of architectures, technologies, and infrastructures. 

Based on the above preference will be given to people with strong interpersonal skills and the ability to work with others. This will require an assessment of these skills during the interview process.
Emphasise diversity and inclusion training. Consider providing training and resources to support diversity and inclusion in the workplace. This could include training on cultural competency, unconscious bias, and disability sensitivity.
