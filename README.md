# critical-studies-Assignment Part 2
 a new space station, one where difference is not erased but embraced：

## for the space environment aspect：
Ensure sufficient space on the space station and support for mobility aids such as wheelchairs and artificial limbs.It has a wide field to avoid narrow and obstructed passages, inclined ramps and multiple styles of handrails, assisted by the sense of touch and hearing.The environment inside the space station should be adjustable to accommodate people with sensory impairments, such as lighting and temperature control. Consider incorporating assistive technologies, such as voice control and large displays, to control precisely using different ways.
The use of different sensory devices, handrails of different heights and structures on the vehicles, as well as the use of new robotic assistants, is reducing the need for people to perform routine tasks.
Due to safety considerations, emergency evacuation procedures should be designed with accessibility in mind to ensure that everyone can safely evacuate the station in the event of an emergency.
## In terms of personal safety: 
emergency evacuation procedures should be designed with accessibility in mind to ensure that everyone can evacuate the station safely in the event of an emergency.Appropriate machine systems and procedures are in place to deal with medical emergencies, fire, equipment failure and other potential hazards.
## Humanities and Arts:
with difference-inclusive disability art, wearable design and assistive design, more inclusive art forms that inspire and promote people to express their differences and artistic language in different ways.

For people with disabilities it will no longer be a service for (supposedly) unfortunate disabled people, but will involve them as developers of technology, eliminating the "special needs" perspective and jointly driving technological change.
Design and technology for people with disabilities will be allowed to co-exist in society, rather than forcing one party to integrate and assimilate, judging by their ability.Technical staff to assist in the design of accessible spaces and meetings.

There are times when the wealth of life experience is not available to the average specialist. Enabling people with disabilities to live independently and making disability and other forms of interdependence can be achieved by redesigning objects with representations of disability as an expression of challenging existing disability science.They will find crip knowing-making in the design and implementation of architectures, technologies, and infrastructures.
