 a new space station, one where difference is not erased but embraced：

## for the space environment aspect：
Ensure sufficient space on the space station and support for mobility aids such as wheelchairs and artificial limbs.It has a wide field to avoid narrow and obstructed passages, inclined ramps and multiple styles of handrails, assisted by the sense of touch and hearing.The environment inside the space station should be adjustable to accommodate people with sensory impairments, such as lighting and temperature control. Consider incorporating assistive technologies, such as voice control and large displays, to control precisely using different ways.
The use of different sensory devices, handrails of different heights and structures on the vehicles, as well as the use of new robotic assistants, is reducing the need for people to perform routine tasks.
Due to safety considerations, emergency evacuation procedures should be designed with accessibility in mind to ensure that everyone can safely evacuate the station in the event of an emergency.
