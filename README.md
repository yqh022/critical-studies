I would classify Victoria Modesta as posthuman, the beginning of her video shows her as a disabled person, perfecting herself and accepting herself through
technological means. In the film, she has mechanical, glowing legs, and in my understanding, posthumanism is a broader term for a philosophical and 
cultural shift away from traditional humanism. More than anything, she believes that technology is changing humanity and can blur the relationship between
technology and humanity. the goal of transhumanism is to transcend the limitations of the human body and mind and create a new type of post-human being.
